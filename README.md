Miyamoto Musashi Tribute Page submission for freeCodeCamp's Legacy Responsive Web Design Certification.

## Description
For [freeCodeCamp's Legacy Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/), they require five projects, this is the first of them, [Build a Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). I chose to make mine a tribute to the greatest Samurai of all time, Miyamoto Musashi.
